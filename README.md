Personal edit of MakeUp shaders.

Differences from the original:
- Subsurface scattering added to more vanilla blocks (incl. vines, dripstone, bamboo)
- Modified exposure calculations, brighter overall (bloom strength is slightly decreased to compensate)
- Alternate blocky cloudmap
- Additional color palettes
- Entity shadows toggle

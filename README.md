Personal edit/retune of MakeUp shaders.

Differences from the original:
- Subsurface scattering added to more vanilla blocks (incl. vines, dripstone, bamboo)
- Adjusted autoexposure; brighter overall
- New cloudmaps: 'blocky' style clouds are larger with denser coverage, 'natural' style clouds are puffier
- New color palettes: 'Vivid' (default), 'Surreal' & 'Real-ish'
- Entity / block entity shadow toggles
- Reorganized settings screen

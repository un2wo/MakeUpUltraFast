Personal edit of MakeUp shaders.

Differences from the original:
- Subsurface scattering added to more vanilla blocks (incl. vines, dripstone, bamboo)
- Brighter autoexposure
- New cloudmaps: 'blocky' style clouds are larger and denser, 'natural' style clouds are puffier
- Additional color palettes ('Vivid' & 'Surreal')
- Entity / Block Entity shadow toggles

Personal edit/retune of MakeUp shaders (9.1e).  
Mainly just fiddling with numbers here; only a few lines of new code were added.  

Differences from the original:
- Adjusted shading for foliage and similar blocks; should look better w/ narrower sun angles and shadowless configurations
- Adjusted autoexposure; brighter overall
- Misc. lighting & color adjustments
- New cloudmaps: 'blocky' style clouds are larger with denser coverage, 'natural' style clouds are puffier
- New color palettes: 'Vivid', 'Prairie' (default), 'Antique', 'Vanillin', 'Pinesap', & 'Outside' (used in screenshot)
- Entity shadow toggles
- Reorganized settings screen
